# Welcome to [DriftBasic.com](https://driftbasic.com) repository

## What is DriftBasic?
DriftBasic is a grassroots drifting community founded by Tommy Ferrence. Our mission is to help keep people off the streets by providing them with a safe and fun track experience. 

Most of our events were held at Darlington Dragway in Hartsville, SC between 2007 to 2016.

Unfortunately we no longer run any events. 

## Why does this project exist?
This is a nostalgia inspired project. Plus we also wanted to keep our most visited page about _troubleshooting fuel system on a Nissan 240SX_ alive!

## Tech stuff
We borrowed some code from an awesome [fullPage.js](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js) project.
